# Game-Programming-Course-Week-3
In the third week of the Game Programming course the focus was on creating enemy interactions and handling player damage. <br>
I applied concepts such as: 
  - Creating an enemy prefab.
  - Writing scripts to control enemy movement, making them fall from the top of the screen at a specified speed.
  - Adding Rigidbody and Collision components to enable physics-based interactions and collision detection between objects.
  - Using Unity's OnTriggerEnter function to detect collisions between the player, enemies, and laser shots.
  - Implementing logic to handle player damage when hit by an enemy, and destroying both the enemy and the laser when they collide.

In this project, the enemies move down the screen, and if they collide with the player, the player takes damage, reducing their lives. Additionally, when a laser shot hits an enemy, both the enemy and the laser are destroyed. This assignment allowed me to build a more interactive game environment while further improving my understanding of Unityâ€™s physics system and scripting for object interactions.
